Introduction
============

This module contains some Bootstrap_ `browser resources`_ for
Zope_. It was originally developed for GroupServer_ (hence the ``gs.``
name-space). However, it is completely devoid of anything that is specific
to GroupServer: any Zope or Plone_ project should be able to make use of
this egg.

Browser Resources
=================

``/++resource++bootstrap-2.2.2/``:
  The directory-resource that contains all the Bootstrap JS (``js/``) and
  images (``img/``).
